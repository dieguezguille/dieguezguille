### Hey there, I'm Guille ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Software Developer with a background in Psychology. I've been both a Microsoft Student Partner and a Microsoft Imagine Cup Finalist in 2012 as well as a Microsoft's Code Camp participant, mainly as a Product Developer. I currently work as a Software Developer for both an international Web3 company and my own, helping shape the present and future of finance and crypto.
