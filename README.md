### Hey there, I'm Guillermo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Software Developer with a background in Psychology. I've been both a Microsoft Student Partner and a Microsoft Imagine Cup Finalist in 2012 as well as a Microsoft's Code Camp participant.

I currently work as a developer for my own company, but hold some small personal projects leveraging both languages and libraries such as Unity, Web3, Solidity, Typescript, React, Node and more. I produce Minimal House music professionally too.
