### Hey there, I'm Guille ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Software Developer with a background in Psychology. I've been both a Microsoft Student Partner and a Microsoft Imagine Cup Finalist in 2012 as well as a Microsoft's Code Camp participant. I am passionate about blockchain technology and would love to help shape the present and future of finance and crypto.
